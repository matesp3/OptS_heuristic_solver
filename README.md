Semester work from subject of Networks optimalisation.
Solving TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) is as follows:
 * retrieving an acceptable solution using simple heuristics (nearest neighbour to all route-included nodes by SUM criteria)
 * then, trying to get better solution by using meta heuristics Simulated Annealing (SA), in which we do inversion of strings to access new surrounding (of parts of an acceptable route)
